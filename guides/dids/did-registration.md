description: Creating, updating & deactivating supported DID methods
---

DID registration covers the three operations that modify a DID, namely "Create", "Update" and "Deactivate". It takes a DID and (often) a DID document as input to perform the requested operation.

Registration is performed as defined in the [DID Core](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and [DID Registration](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/) (draft) specifications. The implementation is based on the [Universal Registrar](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar) project.
