# Presentations

A presentation, short for [Verifiable Presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations), is a data model that allows a Holder of [Verifiable Credentials (VCs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credentials) to present their VCs to a Verifier. The Verifier can then attest the authorship of the credentials included in the presentation.

The data format used for a presentation is [vp-jwt](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-web-token). Other formats are not supported at this time.

## Prerequisites

- [DID](../dids/did-methods.md)
- [Credentials](../credentials/README.md)

## Who can undertake this operation?

Presentations are generated by the Holder and are verified by an Organisation (Verifier), or another user.
