Verifiers can send Wallet Holders request for credentials so they can verify information about the Holder. To receive and submit requests via the Meeco Wallet, you will need to have established a connection with the Verifier (aka Organisation). See the [Organisation Configuration tutorial](organisation-configuration.md) for more details.

## Import a request

To import a request for credentials into your Wallet you will first need to be given a QR Code from the verifying Organisation. Once you have received or been presented with the QR Code, scan it using the in-app scan function in your Wallet. The request will appear as will a toast message notifying you that the request was successfully imported.

## Submit credentials for verification

To submit credentials for verification either scan a QR Code (as mentioned in the above section _Import a request_), or navigate to the _Requests_ section of your Wallet. Tap on the _Pending_ tab and locate the request in the list. Tap on the request to open it. Here you will see the details of the request, including the following information:
- The status of the request (Incomplete or Complete)
- The date the request was received
- Who the request was received from
- Request notes (details from the Verifier as to why the credentials are required)
- The required credentials

Under the section _Requested credentials_ you will see a list of the required credentials. Alongside each credential a button titled _Select_ will be visible. Tap on _Select_ to choose an appropriate credential to submit for verification. A pop-up screen will appear displaying all credentials in your wallet that are the same type as the one being requested. Select the credential you wish to submit for verification. Repeat for all credentials required in the request.

> **Note**
> The Wallet will recognise the type of credential being requested. For example, you will only be able to select an identity credential if that is what is being requested.

Once all credentials have been selected, the _Submit_ button in the top-right corner of the request screen will change to purple. Tap on the _Submit_ button. A pop-up screen will appear asking you to confirm if you wish to submit the selected credentials for verification by the Verifier. Tap on _Submit_ to complete the request or _Cancel_. 

After tapping on the _Submit_ button, a confirmation toast message will appear stating that the Verifier has received your credentials. Tap on the _<Back_ button and you will see that the request will have now moved to the _Completed_ tab in the _Requests_ section of your wallet.
