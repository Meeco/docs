Meeco’s Secure Value Exchange (SVX) Platform enables users to participate in large ecosystems comprising of Issuers, Verifiers, and Holders. These ecosystems are managed by Tenants (also referred to as Providers), and it is the Tenants who enable Holders to connect with Issuers and Verifiers (aka Organisations).

## Register with a Provider
To undertake wallet-specific workflows via the SVX Platform, Holders must first register their wallets with a Provider. After registering their wallet with a Provider, a Holder will be able to gain access to Issuers and Verifiers within the Provider’s ecosystem.

It is the Provider’s responsibility to provide the Holder with a QR Code to enable registration with their Tenancy.

> **Note**
> If you have not received a QR Code from your Provider, please contact them before proceeding.

Once a QR Code has been provided by a Provider that you trust, use the scan function within the Meeco Wallet app to scan the code.

> **Note**
> It may take a few seconds for the registration process to be completed.

## Set a Provider as Active
It is possible to be registered with more than one Provider, however, only one Provider can be set to _Active_ at any one time. To set a Provider as _active_, navigate to _Settings_ and tap on _Provider configuration_. Locate the Provider you wish to set as active in the list and tap on the Provider’s name. You will see a toggle at the top of the screen next to the label _Make this my active Provider_. Tap the toggle so that it changes to purple. A pop-up screen will appear asking you to confirm that you wish to make this Provider active.

> **Note**
> If you are registered with only one Provider, by default this Provider will be _active_.

> **Note**
> Making a Provider _active_ allows you to establish connections with Organisations associated with that Provider.

> **Note**
> Credentials issued by Organisations associated with non-active Providers will remain in your wallet.

## Forget a Provider

If you no longer wish to be registered with a Provider navigate to _Settings_ and tap on _Provider configuration_. Locate the Provider you wish to forget in the list and tap on the Provider’s name. Tap on the _Forget this Provider_ button located at the bottom of the screen. A pop-up screen will appear asking you to confirm that you wish to forget the Provider. Select _Confirm_ to remove the Provider or select _Cancel_. If you select _Confirm_ connections with Organisations will be lost.

> **Note**
> After forgetting a provider you will have 30 days to re-register with them if required. The Provider will need to send you a new QR code to enable this. After re-registering, all associated connections with Organisations will be restored.

## Removal from a Provider

A Provider may remove your registered wallet from their Tenancy. If this occurs you will be notified via a pop-up notification when using your wallet app. If the Provider _was_ your active Provider, another Provider will be activated by default. If the Provider _was not_ your active Provider, your active Provider will remain active.
