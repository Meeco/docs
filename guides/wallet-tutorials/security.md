The security of your wallet is paramount as the verifiable credentials stored within may contain personally identifiable information (PII). The Meeco Wallet is a decentralised application by design, meaning that any data stored in the app cannot be accessed or viewed by a third party unless the Holder provides their consent. The primary means of security when accessing your Meeco Wallet is either a PIN or biometrics (see below for details).

## PIN management

At time of wallet set up you will be required to set either a 6-digit PIN or biometrics as the primary way to unlock your wallet (see the [Wallet Set Up tutorial](../guides/wallet-tutorials/wallet-set-up.md) for more information). If you choose to secure your wallet with only a PIN you will be required to enter your PIN every time you open your wallet app.

### Changing your PIN

If you wish to change your PIN, navigate to _Settings_ and tap on _Secure your wallet_. Toggle the switch next to _Use PIN Code_ so that it turns off. Tap on the toggle once again to activate the PIN code function. You will be presented with a screen asking you to ‘Set your PIN code’. Tap on the first empty circle to activate your device’s key pad. Enter your selected 6-digit PIN. Re-enter the 6-digit PIN to confirm, and your new PIN will be implemented.

> **Note**
> While it is possible to turn off the PIN code and biometrics functionality, we strongly advise that you secure your wallet app with at least one method of security.

## Biometrics

At time of wallet set up you will be required to set either a 6-digit PIN or biometrics as the primary way to unlock your wallet (see the [Wallet Set Up tutorial](../guides/wallet-tutorials/wallet-set-up.md) for more information). If you choose to secure your wallet with biometrics you will be required to either make your face visible to your device’s camera or scan your fingerprint every time you open your wallet app.

> **Note**
> You will need to have biometrics enabled for apps on your device, otherwise the Meeco Wallet will not present this as a security option.

### Enable and Disable Biometrics

If you decide to enable or disable biometrics after you have completed wallet set up, navigate to _Settings_ and tap on _Secure your wallet_. Toggle the switch next to _Use Biometrics_ so that it turns on. Follow the prompts to enable biometric unlock. To disable biometrics, toggle the switch next to _Use Biometrics_ so that it turns off.

> **Note**
> While it is possible to turn off the PIN code and biometrics functionality, we strongly advise that you secure your wallet app with at least one method of security.

## Auto lock

The auto lock feature allows you to set a specific amount of time before the Meeco Wallet locks when running in the background of your device. This is an additional security measure to ensure other users of your device can’t access your wallet when it’s left unattended.

### Enable and Disable auto lock

You can enable / disable the auto lock feature to ensure the Meeco Wallet app locks when running in the background of your device. To do this navigate to _Settings_ and tap on _Secure your wallet_. Toggle the switch next to _Enable auto lock_ so that it turns on. A slide bar will appear below. Tap and drag the circle along the slide bar or tap on the bar itself to increase the time before the app will auto lock (increments of 10 seconds). To disable auto lock, toggle the switch next to _Enable auto lock_ so that it turns off.
