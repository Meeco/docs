Meeco’s Secure Value Exchange (SVX) Platform enables users to participate in large ecosystems comprising of Issuers, Verifiers, and Holders. These ecosystems are managed by Tenants (also referred to as Providers), and it is the Tenants who enable Holders to connect with Issuers and Verifiers (aka Organisations).

## Connect with an Organisation

To be issued credentials and to submit credentials for verification via the wallet, connections with Organisation need to be created. After registering your wallet with a Provider, you will be able to gain access to Organisations (Issuers and Verifiers) within the Provider’s ecosystem.

First, the Organisation will need to provide you with an invitation code. Once you have received the invitation code navigate to _Settings_ and tap on _Organisation configuration_. Tap on the _Enter invitation code_ button located at the bottom of the screen. You will be presented with a form asking you to enter the following information:
- Invitation code
- Connection name

Once all required fields are complete select the _Continue_ button. A toast message will appear confirming that the connection has been created and the Organisation will appear in the list.

> **Note**
> It may take a few seconds for the connection to be established.

## Forget a Connection

If you no longer wish to be connected with an Organisation navigate to _Settings_ and tap on _Organisation configuration_. Locate the Organisation you wish to forget in the list and tap on the Organisation’s name. Tap on the _Forget this connection_ button located at the bottom of the screen. A pop-up screen will appear asking you to confirm that you wish to forget the Organisation. Select _Confirm_ to disconnect from the Organisation or select _Cancel_.

> **Note**
> After cancelling a connection with an Organisation all credentials issued by the Organisation will remain in your wallet.

## Removal from an Organisation
An Organisation may cancel and remove the connection with your wallet. If this occurs you will be notified via a pop-up notification when using your wallet app.
