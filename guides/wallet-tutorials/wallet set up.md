### Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy

As part of the wallet set up, every Wallet Holder is required to consent to Meeco’s [Terms & Conditions](https://www.meeco.me/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.meeco.me/privacy). Meeco empowers people to take control of their personal data and manage it in a safe and secure way. The Meeco Wallet is a decentralised application by design, meaning that any data stored in the app cannot be accessed or viewed by a third party unless the Holder provides their consent.

### Secure your wallet

By default, the Meeco Wallet requires all Holders to secure their wallet with a PIN. If biometric finger and/or face scanning is enabled on the device, this method can also be employed. Via the wallet’s _Settings_, a Holder can also designate the length of time before the application locks when open in the device’s background.
