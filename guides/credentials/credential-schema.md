# Introduction
Within the SVX Platform, credential schemas are used to form the basis of a verifiable credential. They structure a set of claims about a Holder and determine the logic behind how the claims are used. Without credential schemas, verifiable credentials would not be able to be issued.


## Inputs
JSON credential schema file

## Outputs
Uploaded/updated credential schema on server and is ready for the next use.


# Additional considerations
Each JSON Schema consists of the following mandatory attributes:

* type (e.g. JsonSchemaValidator2018). The specific type definition determines the content of each data schema.

* id (a URI that identifies the schema file)

Credential schema upload is available to Tenant Administrators and must comply with the following rules:

* A plain JSON object.

* The structure is later checked based on the specification: JSON Schema

All the attributes in the example are required, but values could be different, e.g. URL address of Schema, name, description etc.



### Example credential JSON schema

```bash
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/schema",
  "name": "Example",
  "description": "Example",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {

    "id": {
      "type": "string",
    }
  },
  "required": ["id"],
  "additionalProperties": false,
}
```
## Create Credential Schema

**Endpoint**

```bash
POST /schemas
```

**Request**

* Name â€“ name of the credential schema
* JSON Schema - json-file with the Credential Schema created based on the requiremenes
* List of organisations - consists of organisations where this credential schema can be used. optional parametr, can be completed later

**Responses**

The credential schema object that is created.

## View Credential Schemas

Retrieve a list of credential schemas.

**Request**

```bash
GET /schemas
 ```

**Request**

* Organisation (header)

**Responses**

* List of credential schema objects

The endpoint works for a Tenant and Organisation user based on the X-Meeco-Organisation-ID header.

Returns a list of schemas available to the caller.

In the context of an organisation, entering organization_ids `organization_ids` list always contains only one item - caller organisation ID.

## Edit Credential Schemas
We need to use the following endpoint for editing Credential Schema:

**Endpoint:**

```bash
PUT /schemas/{id} - apply all changes
 ```
**Request**

* ID of Credential Schema

**Responses**

* Edited Credential Schema (only name or available organisations can be edited)


## Retrieve Credential Schema definition 

**Endpoint**

```bash
GET /schemas/{id}/{version}/schema.json
```

**Request**

* ID of Credential Schema
* version

**Responses**

* Schema json retrived
