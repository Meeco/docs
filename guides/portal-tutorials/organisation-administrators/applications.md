## Introduction

Applications leverage [OAuth2's client credentials grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/client-credentials/), a protocol designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication. In this setup, a client ID and client secret are used to authenticate and obtain an access token. This token, representing the specific application rather than a user, is then used to authorise the application to perform specific operations such as credential issuance, revocation and verification, and managing Organisation Administrators within the context of a particular Organisation. This approach enables secure and controlled access for services.

## Create an application

Organisation Administrators can create a new application by navigating to _Devtools_ on the left-side menu of the SVX Portal, and selecting _Applications_. After selecting the _Create application_ button, you will be presented with a form. The form consists of the following fields:
* Application name
* Application description

> **Note**
> _Application description:_ Enter a description so that users know what the application is and / or is used for.

Once all required fields are complete select the _Create application_ button and the application will appear in a list with a designated Client ID.

## View and edit an application

Organisation Administrators can view applications by navigating to _Devtools_ on the left-side menu of the SVX Portal, and selecting _Applications_.

Locate the application in the list and select the horizontal ellipsis icon ‚ãØ alongside the application‚Äôs name to reveal menu options. Select _View_. You will be presented with the following information:
* Application name
* Application description
* Domain
* Client ID
* Client secret

> **Note**
> _Client ID:_ You can copy this information to your clipboard.

> **Note**
> _Client secret:_ This field is hidden for security and privacy reasons. Click on the eye üëÅ icon to reveal the entire secret.

To edit the application‚Äôs details, select the _Edit_ button from the _View application_ page or select _Edit_ from the horizontal ellipsis icon ‚ãØ alongside the application‚Äôs name. The information will be presented as an editable form where you can update / change the following fields:
* Application name
* Application description

When complete, select _Save_ to save changes, or _Cancel_ to discard changes.

## Enable machine-2-machine authentication

An Organisation Administrator can provide an application with authenticated access to SVX functionality. This allows the application to perform the following actions:
* Create and archive credential templates
* Issue and revoke credentials
* Create and archive verification templates
* Create verification requests and view verification responses
* Create and cancel connections with end-users

Once an application has been created, the Organisation Administrator can navigate to _Devtools_ on the left-side menu of the SVX Portal, select _Applications_, locate the application in the list and select the horizontal ellipsis icon ‚ãØ alongside the application‚Äôs name to reveal menu options. After selecting _View_ you will be able to copy the Client ID and Client Secret which you can use to provide your application authenticated access to the SVX Platform.

## Delete an application

To remove an application from your Organisation navigate to _Devtools_ on the left-side menu of the SVX Portal, and select _Applications_. Locate the application in the list and select the horizontal ellipsis icon ‚ãØ alongside the application‚Äôs name to reveal menu options. Select _Delete_ and confirm the deletion of the application via the modal window. The application will be permanently deleted from the Tenant, and will no longer appear in the list.
