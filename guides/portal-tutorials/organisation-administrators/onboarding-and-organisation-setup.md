## Invitation emails

Organisations are managed by Organisation Administrators. Organisation Administrators gain access to an Organisation via an invitation email. The first Organisation Administrator to join an Organisation will receive an invitation email from a Tenant Administrator. Subsequent Organisation Administrators can be invited by existing Organisation Administrators.

To accept an invitation email, navigate to your email inbox. Locate the email sent from _SVX Support_ with the subject heading _Invite to join (Organisation name) Organisation_.

### First time invitation to the SVX Portal

If this is your first invitation to join SVX, the email will contain:
- The name of the person who invited you, and
- Steps on how to access the SVX Portal. These steps include:
  - Navigating to the registration URL
  - Entering your temporary password
  - Setting a new password

After clicking on the registration URL, you will be presented with the SVX registration screen. Enter the temporary password that was provided to you, set your new password and accept Meeco’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.meeco.me/privacy-policy) and [Terms and Conditions](https://www.meeco.me/terms). Click _Next_ to log in. You will be asked to set up your Organisation's Passphrase. See the section below titled [Setup the Organisation's Passphrase](onboarding-and-organisation-setup.md#setup-an-organisations-passphrase) for more information.

### Subsequent invitations to the SVX Portal

It is possible for an Organisation Administrator to be invited to join other Organisations or Tenancies. In this case, the SVX Portal will recognise the Organisation Administrator as an existing  user. All subsequent invitation emails will state: 
- Which Tenant or Organisation you have been invited to join
- The name of the person who invited you
- A URL to access the SVX Portal, and
- A reminder to use your existing login details

After clicking on the _Portal Login_ URL you will be presented with the SVX login screen. Enter your email address as your username, then enter your password. Click _Log in_ to continue to the SVX Portal. You will land on the Tenant / Organisation selection screen. Click on your Tenant or Organisation to navigate to the associated Dashboard.

If you have been invited to an Organisation, after clicking on the Organisation in the list, you will be prompted to enter the associated _Passphrase_. See the section below titled [Setup the Organisation's Passphrase](onboarding-and-organisation-setup.md#setup-an-organisations-passphrase) for more information.

## Set Up an Organisation’s Passphrase

### First Administrator to join the Organisation

If you are the first Organisation Administrator from your Organisation to login to the SVX Portal you will be presented with the option to set up your Organisation’s Passphrase. This passphrase is unique to your Organisation and ensures that only Organisation Administrators who have entered the passphrase will be able to access all available features and functions. With this in mind, if you decide to set up your Organisation’s passphrase at this point in time, please consider the following:

You will need to distribute the passphrase to other Organisation Administrators who wish to access all features and functions within the Portal.

To set up the Organisation's passphrase, first read the information presented on the setup screen. Click on _Continue_ to proceed to the passphrase or _Skip_ to navigate to the Organisation's dashbaord. After clicking _Continue_ you will be presented with the partially hidden passphrase in a non-editable text field. You can click on the eye 👁 icon to reveal the entire passphrase. Next, click on the _Copy Passphrase to clipboard_ button then click _Next_. Paste the passphrase in the empty text field and clik the _Done_ button.

A modal will appear confirming that passphrase setup is complete. Click _OK_ to close the modal and navigate to the Organisation's dashboard.

> **Note**
> If you lose the passphrase it is not retrievable and access to your Organisation will be lost. Please only share the passphrase with known users who require access to the Organisation via SVX.

You can choose to skip set up of the passphrase, however you will have limited access to the components within the Portal.

> **Note**
> If you skip set up of your Organisation's passphrase, you can add the passphrase at a later date. For more information, see the section below titled [Subsequent Portal Sessions](#subsequent-portal-sessions).

</p>

### Subsequent Administrators

If you are invited to join the Organisation and the associated passphrase has already been set up, you will need to enter the Organisation's passphrase when you first try to access the Organisation.

After actioning an invitation email or by clicking on a new Organisation that appears in your Organisations list, you will be prompted to enter the Organisation's passphrase. To do this, acquire the passphrase from another Organisation Administrator, click in the text box on the Passphrase screen, then click the _Login_ button. You will be navigated to the Organisation's dashboard.

You can choose to skip setup of the passphrase by clicking on the _Skip for now_ button, however, you will have limited access to the components within the Portal.

### Subsequent Portal Sessions

If you have been invited to join an Organisation, and have logged in but _skipped_ the passphrase setup step, it is possible to add the Organisation's passphrase during the current or subsequent session. To do this, navigate to _Manage Organisation_ and click on _Account settings_. Click on the _Authorization_ tab and enter the Passphrase in the corresponding field. Click on the _Confirm Passphrase_ button. A confirmation toast message will appear on successful entry of the Organisation's passphrase.
