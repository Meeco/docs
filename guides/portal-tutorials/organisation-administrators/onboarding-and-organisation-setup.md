## Login to the SVX Portal

Each Organisation is associated with a Tenant. For an Organisation Administrator to gain access to the SVX Portal, a Tenant Administrator will first need to send them an invitation email with instructions on how to login. The email received includes a link to the Portal and a temporary password. Click the link to the Portal, enter your email address as your username and the provided temporary password. You will be required to set a new password for future use. You will also be required to agree to Meeco’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.meeco.me/privacy-policy) and [Terms and Conditions](https://www.meeco.me/terms).

## Setup the Organisation’s Passphrase

If you are the first Organisation Administrator from your Organisation to login to the SVX Portal you will be presented with the option to setup your Organisation’s Passphrase. This passphrase is unique to your Organisation and ensures that only Organisation Administrators who have entered the passphrase will be able to access all available features and functions. With this in mind, if you decide to setup your Organisation’s passphrase at this point in time, please consider the following:

You will need to distribute the passphrase to other Organisation Administrators who wish to access all features and functions within the Portal.

> **Note**
> If you lose the passphrase it is not retrievable and access to your Organisation will be lost.

You can choose to skip setup of the passphrase, however, you will have limited access to the components within the Portal.
