## View a credential

To view a credential navigate to _Credentials_ on the left-side menu of the SVX Portal, and select _View Credentials_. Find the credential in the list either by using the sort or search function. Once located, select the horizontal ellipsis icon ⋯ to reveal menu options. Select _View credential_.

You will be presented with a summary of the credential, including:
* VC ID
* Credential template
* Date issued
