## View Account Settings

Organisation Administrators can view their Organisation’s account settings by navigating to _Manage Organisation_ on the left-side menu of the SVX Portal, and selecting _Account Settings_.
Here you will see two tabs:

- Authorisation

Under the _General_ tab the following information is presented:
- Organisation name
- Organisation URL
- Organisation ID

> **Note**
> The Organisation ID is designated by the SVX Portal at the time the Organisation is created.

Under the _Authorisation_ tab the following information is presented:
- The Organisation’s _Passphrase_.

> **Note**
> For security reasons the Organisation’s Passphrase will appear hidden by default. Click on the eye icon 👁 to view the entire Passphrase.

## Edit Account Settings

To edit your Organisation’s details, select the _Edit_ button on the _Account Settings_ page under the _General_ tab. The information will be presented as an editable form where you can update / change the following information:

To change the Organisation’s logo either drag and drop the new logo file into the outlined logo box or select _click here_ to navigate to the new logo’s location on your device. The new logo will appear in the preview box.

When complete, select _Save_ to save changes, or _Cancel_ to discard changes.
