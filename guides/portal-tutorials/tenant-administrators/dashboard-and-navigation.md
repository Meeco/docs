## Dashboard

After logging into a Tenant, Tenant Administrators are presented with their Tenant Dashboard. The Dashboard contains quick links that enable the Administrator to perform actions within the SVX Portal. These quick links are presented as tiles. Each tile displays a section of the Portal and a brief description of the actions a user can take within that section.

The tiles that appear on a Tenant Dashboard include:
- Organisations
- Credentials
- Manage Tenancy
- Documentation
- Helpdesk

## Navigation

### Toolbar

The toolbar appears at the top of the Portal user interface (UI) and is permanently visible.

<p align="center">
<img align="center" src="/.gitbook/assets/Toolbar.png" width="100%">
</p>

Three icons appear in the top-right corner of the toolbar:
- Security
- Documentation
- Helpdesk

All three icons enable Administrators to navigate to external resource sites, however, the security icon also acts as a visual indicator of secure information being presented on the screen (see below for more details).

</p>

### Security

The security icon only appears on the toolbar on pages that contain a security component. These security components contain personally identifiable information (PII) and are only visible to Administrators with the assocaited permissions. These components can be identified via the security icon centred in a green circle in the top-left of the component's heading. They also have a grey background that creates a box for the private information to sit inside.

If an Adminsitrator does not have the required permissions to view the sensitive information, a condensed security component will be visible with the following text _"You do not have permission to view this information. To view this information enter the Organisation’s passphrase."_.

> **Why is this important?**
> This icon indicates to Administrators which personally identifiable information (PII), or other sensitive data is visible to them (or not) based on their access permissions. This is important as sensitive data should only be accessible to authorised users.

</p>

When a user lands on a page that has a security container component, or when a user closes a security explainer component, a green ring around the security icon on the toolbar will animate (the green circle will loop twice around the icon).

When hovering over the security icon, or after clicking the icon on the toolbar, a message will appear below stating _**“Privately viewed information.** This information is only visible to Organisation Administrators with the associated permissions.”_

### Documentation

When hovering over the documentation icon, a message will appear below stating _**“Documentation.** Click to navigate to SVX documentation.”_ After clicking on the documentation icon, you will be taken to the SVX supporting [documentation landing page](https://docs.meeco.me/). Here you will find API documentation and step-by-step tutorials.

### Helpdesk

When hovering over the helpdesk icon, a message will appear below stating _**“Helpdesk.** Click to navigate to the SVX Helpdesk. Lodge help requests, bug reports, or suggestions.”_ After clicking on the helpdesk icon, you will be taken to the SVX Helpdesk landing page.

Via the SVX Helpdesk landing page, Administrators can choose to lodge help requests, bug reports, or suggestions. These requests will be recorded and given a unique identifier. Status updates and correspondence regarding a request will be available to the Administrator who lodged it. Correspondence and notifications will be sent to the Administrator via their registered email address.
