## Invitation emails

Tenants are managed by Tenant Administrators. Tenant Administrators gain access to a Tenancy via an invitation email. The first Tenant Administrator to join a Tenancy will receive an invitation email from a Meeco Administrator. Subsequent Tenant Administrators can be invited by existing Tenant Administrators.

To accept an invitation email, navigate to your email inbox. Locate the email sent from _SVX Support_ with the subject heading _Invite to join (Tenant name) Tenancy_.

### First time invitation to the SVX Portal

If this is your first invitation to join SVX, the email will contain:
- The name of the person who invited you, and
- Steps on how to access the SVX Portal. These steps include:
  - Navigating to the registration URL
  - Entering your temporary password
  - Setting a new password

After clicking on the registration URL, you will be presented with the SVX registration screen. Enter the temporary password that was provided to you, set your new password and accept Meecoâ€™s [Privacy Policy](https://www.meeco.me/privacy-policy) and [Terms and Conditions](https://www.meeco.me/terms). Click _Next_ to log in. You will land on the Tenant selection screen. Click on your Tenant and you will land on the associated Dashboard.

### Subsequent invitations to the SVX Portal

It is possible for a Tenant Administrator to be invited to join other Tenancies and / or Organisations. In this case, the SVX Portal will recognise the Tenant Administrator as an existing Portal user. All subsequent invitation emails will state: 
- Which Tenant or Organisation you have been invited to join
- The name of the person who invited you
- A URL to access the SVX Portal, and
- A reminder to use your existing login details

After clicking on the _Portal Login_ URL, you will be presented with the SVX login screen. Enter your email address (as your username) and your password. Click _Log in_ to continue to the SVX Portal. You will land on the Tenant selection screen. Click on your Tenant or Organisation to navigate to the associated Dashboard.

> **Note**
> If you are joining an Organisation you will be asked to either set up or enter the Organisation's Passphrase. For more information, see the [Onboarding and Organisation Setup](../organisation-administrators/onboarding-and-organisation-setup.md) tutorial.
