To onboard to SVX you will first need to sign up. Navigate to our [sign up form](https://www.meeco.me/signup) to gain access to our Sandbox. Once your access has been approved, you will be able to [log in to the SVX Portal](https://portal-sandbox.securevalueexchange.com/login). From here you can either:
* Use the Portal UI to undertake workflows, or
* Create an application to obtain an access token for access to the SVX Sandbox API.

## Using the Portal UI

To navigate the Portal, refer to the Portal tutorials where you can find step-by-step instructions to manage a Tenancy and / or an Organisation.

## Accessing the SVX Sandbox API

To directly access the SVX Sandbox API you will need to follow the steps below:

#### 1. Access the SVX Sandbox API documentation:

Navigate to the [SVX Sandbox API documentation](https://api-reference-sandbox.svx.exchange/). At the top of the landing page, you will see the OpenAPI3 specification. Download the specification and import it into [Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/integrations/available-integrations/working-with-openAPI/).

> **Note**
> To download the OpenAPI3 specification into Postman, follow these simple steps:
> 1. Download the specification from the [API documentation landing page](https://api-reference-sandbox.svx.exchange/)
> 2. Open Postman
> 3. Import the downloaded .json file

#### 2. Create an application:

Log in to the [SVX Portal](https://portal-sandbox.securevalueexchange.com/login) and create an application, see the Applications tutorial located in the Portal tutorials section. 

> **Note**
> Tenant and Organisation Administrators can both create Applications, however, different workflows are achieved based on the associated role and access rights.

> **Note**
> Once an application has been created, ensure you record the ``client_id`` and ``client-secret``. 

#### 3. Open the API configuration

View the Open API configuration at https://login-sandbox.securevalueexchange.com/oauth2/.well-known/openid-configuration and retrieve your authorisation token.

Use the token endpoint from the configuration (https://login-sandbox.securevalueexchange.com/oauth2/token) to obtain an authorisation token. You can do this using the cURL command as shown below:
```bash
   curl -X POST https://login-sandbox.securevalueexchange.com/oauth2/token \
   -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
   -d 'client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID' \
   -d 'client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
```
Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with the actual values you obtained when creating the application.

#### 4. Access the SVX Sandbox API

With the obtained authorisation token, you can now use the SVX Sandbox API. For example, if you want to access the ``me`` endpoint, use the following cURL command:
```bash
   curl --location 'https://api-sandbox.svx.exchange/me' \
   --header 'Meeco-Organisation-Id: YOUR_ORGANISATION_ID' \
   --header 'Accept: application/json' \
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
```
Replace `YOUR_ORGANISATION_ID` with the relevant ID for your organisation, and `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token obtained in the previous step. You should now be able to successfully access the SVX Sandbox API using the provided authorisation token.Â
