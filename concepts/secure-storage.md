# Secure Data Storage

Secure data storage refers to both the manual and automated processes and technologies used to ensure data is secured at rest. Regardless of the type of data, it is important to store data securely on public and private servers, cloud storage solutions, hard drives, portable devices and any (IoT) device with storage. Secure data storage is achieved via the implementation of data security processes, including, but not limited to:

* Data loss prevention (DLP)
* Encryption
* Access controls
* Secure storage and backup
* Watermarking and hashing

By implementing strong data security practices, individuals and enterprises can prevent loss or manipulation of data through unauthorised access. These practices also involve operational procedures such as preventing cyber attacks and go as far as checking if the server room is locked.

## Meecoâ€™s Secure Storage Solution

Meeco has developed the Meeco Vault, a flexible secure data storage option that provides end-to-end encryption on all data types. It also includes encrypted peer-to peer-sharing with granular control over the shares. Via the use of the Vault APIs, our secure data technology can be embedded in new and existing applications such as digital wallets, mobile apps, web portals or back-up services. By default, users and organisations are authenticated via an OIDC provider. For more information visit [Platform - Vault](../platform/vault/overview.md) page.
