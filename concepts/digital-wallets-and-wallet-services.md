Digital wallets enable users to manage their digital assets easily and securely from the device(s) of their choosing. Wallets are commonly used for the management of data and transactions, ranging from identity documentation (driver licences and certificates), financial (payments and transfers), tokens (fungible and non-fungible), and loyalty programs (vouchers and point accumulation). Wallets can be divided into two categories: single purpose or multi-purpose. Single purpose wallets focus on the management of one service, while multipurpose deliver a range of services that can be inter-linked or standalone.

## Types of Wallets
There are three types of wallets, and any of them may be fully decentralised, centralised, or managed:
- Non-custodial – all the associated keys are under the control of the Holder (most likely decentralised).
- Custodial – all the associated keys are under the control of the custodian (most likely centralised).
- Hybrid – a combination of Holder and custodian controls (most likely managed).

Non-custodial wallets operate as per the Holder’s discretion and cannot be accessed by third parties unless the Holder provides consent. Generally, a non-custodial wallet is not linked to any external data storage, therefore, if the Holder loses their device or is locked out of their wallet application, they are unable to retrieve the contents of the wallet.

Custodial wallets enable third parties to manage a Holder’s data on their behalf. Generally, third parties acting on a wallet Holder’s behalf work as intermediaries between the Holder and other wallets / services.

A hybrid wallet can support Privacy & Security-by-Design by enabling the Holder to maximise their privacy and exercise their data rights. However, as it is partly custodial, it can provide an option to help the Holder if they lose their wallet or obtain a new device. This may include key or escrow services, together with wallet back-up capabilities.

## What is an Identity Wallet?
An identity wallet focuses on the safeguarding and management of a Holder’s identity data. The wallet acts as a digital container that stores and manages the Holder’s:
1. Decentralised identifiers (DIDs), included in decentralised, Self-Sovereign or Reusable Identity
2. Public and private cryptographic keys
3. Credentials (Verifiable Credentials)

### What core functions are required in an identity/credential Wallet?
The purpose of a wallet is to “sign” transactions and provide cryptographic proof of the transactions. Wallets used in decentralised, self-sovereign and reusable identity all provide services to a Holder.

A Holder wallet must provide a user facing form-factor that will enable the Holder to:
1. Bootstrap the wallet by binding an identity
2. Request and receive credentials
3. Initiate scanning functionality
4. Present (and possibly selectively disclose) credentials
5. Manage credentials including auditing capabilities & consent management
6. Manage public and private keys
7. Manage user settings
8. Provide help functionality

## Wallet Services
Hedera Token Service
The Hedera Token Service (HTS) provides an alternate option for users wanting to transact in native fungible and non-fungible tokens on a public service (the Hedera network). In comparison with other blockchain services, the HTS offers:
- high-throughput
- low fees
- compliance configurations
- on-chain programmability

The HTS simplifies the processes users undertake when taking part in token creation, acquisition, management and transfer. It facilitates payments in different stablecoins and cryptocurrencies and utilises supply chain technology to verify the authenticity of digital or physical assets. By utilising the HTS, renewable energy credit (REC) marketplaces and platforms are provided a way to reduce costs and achieve the sustainability goals.
