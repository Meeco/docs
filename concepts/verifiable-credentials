Digital credentials are becoming more commonly used to assert information about individuals. Verifiable Credentials (VCs) enable individuals to share their credentials with third-parties to prove they poses certain attributes, knowledge and permissions in a machine-verifiable way. VCs differentiate themselves from other digital credentials by including digital signatures (provided by the actors involved in the transaction). These signatures ensure that VCs are unable to be tampered with post-issuance, thus making them more secure and reliable.

## The VC Ecosystem
### VCs and how they are different to documents and data
VCs are compiled of a set of claims made about a Holder / Subject. They can be imagined as digital equivalents of physical documents (e.g. driver licences, passports, birth certificates). What differentiates them from physical documents and other non-secure forms of digital data is that they are tamper-resistant and can be cryptographically verified. In addition to this, VCs:
- are based on international standards such as those published by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)
- include decentralised identifiers (DIDs) (for all actors)
- are designed to be globally interoperable
- require cryptographic proof throughout the credential lifecycle
- can be used across ecosystems
- adhere to a common schema
- utilise common / shared lists for resolving and revocation

## Actors and the VC workflow
A VC ecosystem generally consists of three actors: an Issuer, a Verifier, and a Holder. At the centre of the ecosystem is the Holder / Subject, who is the owner of their personal data. While the Holder may own the data, it is the Issuer who generates and provides the data to the Holder. They do this via the use of VCs. When an Issuer issues a VC to a Holder, the VC contains:
- a set of claims about the Holder (e.g. name, date of birth)
- the Issuer’s signature
- credential metadata (e.g. expiry date)
- credential identifier (a unique number)

Once issued, Holders can store their VCs in a digital wallet. In the event a Holder needs to provide evidence of their identity, a skill, access rights etc. they can share proof of one or more claims stored within their VC(s) to actors inside the ecosystem called Verifiers via Verifiable Presentations. A Verifiable Presentation is the requested information (VCs) packaged by the Holder and presented to a Verifier. On verification of a VC, Verifiers will check:
- that the claims received are about the Holder
- the Issuer’s signature
- credential metadata (e.g. expiry date)

## Verifiable data registries
A verifiable data registry (VDR) is a role undertaken by a system within a VC Ecosystem. The purpose of this role is to mediate the actions undertaken by the actors in the ecosystem. These actions include the creation and verification of identifiers, keys, VC schemas etc. VDRs take many forms, depending on the type of ecosystem being orchestrated will determine which VDR should be used. When sharing and exchanging VCs, the W3C trust model only requires that “all entities trust the verifiable data registry to be tamper-evident and to be a correct record of which data is controlled by which entities.” The different types of VDRs include:
- Trusted databases - a database governed by one or more organisations that is managed centrally, across multiple systems or on a cloud.
- Ledgers - a verifiable transaction log where entries are only ever added, not removed from the ledger.
 - Centralised ledgers - managed by a ledger operator and does not require a consensus mechanism.
 - Distributed ledgers - a ledger that is replicated across many systems or entities, where transactions are updated in unison. Requires a consensus mechanism.
 - Blockchains - uses cryptographically linked blocks of data that build as more transactions occur.

Meeco’s products are VDR agnostic, any of the above VDR types can be used when creating and managing a VC Ecosystem with Meeco technology.

## Digital wallets
Digital wallets enable users to manage their digital assets easily and securely from the device(s) of their choosing. Wallets are commonly used for the management of data and transactions, ranging from identity documentation (driver licences and certificates), financial (payments and transfers), tokens (fungible and non-fungible), and loyalty programs (vouchers and point accumulation). To better understand how VCs are managed in digital wallets, see our Digital Wallets information page.
