  | Decentralized Identifier (DID)                           |[URIs](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-uri "https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-uri") that associate a [DID subject](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects "https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects") with a [DID document](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-did-documents "https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-did-documents") allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject. <br> [DIDs](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers "https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers") have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities. Specifically, the controller of a [DID](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers "https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers") can prove control over it without requiring permission from any other party. |
  | Derivation Artefact                                      | Required in the process of generating or re-generating a **Passphrase Derived Key**. Derivation Artefacts include: <br> &#8226; Number of iterations <br> &#8226; Salt <br> &#8226; Derived key length <br> In the current iteration of our [*Secret Key*](https://meecosystem.atlassian.net/concepts/terminology#secret-key "/concepts/terminology#secret-key") authentication and passphrase derivation the number of keys `Number of iterations` and `Derived key length` are static and the Salt is pulled from the Secret Key.<br> Derivation artefacts are stored in the [Keystore](https://meecosystem.atlassian.net/concepts/terminology#keystore "/concepts/terminology#keystore"). Neither the **Passphrase Derived Key** itself nor the **Passphrase** are stored in the **Keystore**.                                                                                                                                                                 |
