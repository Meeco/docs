# Secure Value Exchange Platform

## Introduction
Meeco’s SVX Platform is a series of components that enable enterprises to put their customers in control of their personal data, identity and digital assets. These components can be integrated into existing systems via our APIs, via Meeco’s SDK, or via our standalone tools: our Enterprise Portal and Meeco Wallet as a way for enterprise customers to deploy trusted personal data ecosystems. Our SVX Platform is built on core capabilities, including: secure data storage, verifiable credentials management, and digital asset management. Details of the Platform’s components and architecture can be seen below.

## Components
The components that form Meeco’s SVX Platform can be used individually, or combined to enable enterprises with complete data and digital asset management solutions. Each component has been designed to address specific issues and concerns experienced by companies transitioning to and working in Web3. Some of these issues include:

* Secure data storage and management (workplace, customer and asset data)

* Verifiable credentials (issuing, revoking and verifying credentials)

* Digital assets (decentralised identifiers, tokens and NFTs)

* Cryptographic key management

* Consent, permission and authorisation management

Each component can be accessed via our extensive set of APIs and CLI, or via our low-code Enterprise Portal and digital Wallet application. For more information on each component, please select the component tile below.

## Platform Deliverables
The SVX Platform has been designed and developed with key values in mind:

* Remove friction

* Enable trust

* Manage risk

* Personalise experiences

* Increase loyalty

* Develop new Web3 business models

These values have been formed after extensive research into the Web3 domain, with a focus on the requirements of the businesses and organisations who engage in it. By developing flexible digital components that can be implemented in any discipline, domain or ecosystem, we hope enterprises can:

* Restore digital equity and trust between companies and their customers

* Reduce costs

* Meet data compliance requirements

When using Meeco’s set of components, these deliverables can be easily achieved as each component has been created with security, privacy, standards and regulatory compliance in mind. We encourage you to review our information documentation or speak to us today to discuss how we can help your company deliver more robust, secure and compliant Web3 infrastructure.
