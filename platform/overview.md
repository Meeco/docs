# Secure Value Exchange Platform

Meeco’s SVX Platform is a series of components that enable enterprises to put their customers in control of their personal data, identity and digital assets. These components can be integrated into existing systems via our APIs, SDK, or standalone tools as a way for enterprise customers to deploy trusted personal data ecosystems. The SVX Platform at its core provides the following capabilities: secure data storage, verifiable credentials management, and digital asset management. Details of the Platform’s components and architecture can be seen below.

## Components

Components can be used individually, or combined to enable enterprises with extensive data and digital asset management solutions. Each component has been designed to address specific issues and concerns in those areas. These include:

* Secure data storage and management (workplace, customer and asset data)
* Verifiable credentials (issuing, revoking and verifying credentials)
* Digital asset management (decentralised identifiers)
* Cryptographic key management
* Consent, permission and authorisation management

Each component can be accessed via our extensive Platform API, SDK, or via our low-code Enterprise Portal and digital Wallet application. For more information on each component, please select the component tile below.

## Platform Deliverables

The SVX Platform has been designed and developed with key values in mind:
