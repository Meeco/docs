Meeco's Authorisation, Tenant and Organisation Manager (ATOM) enables the creation of a hierarchy of organisations within the Secure Value Exchange (SVX) platform. These organisations have associated administrator roles, which are defined as Tenant Administrators and Organisation Administrators. Dependent on the role, an Administrator will have a set of security rights which denote what actions they can undertake. ATOM manages not only Administrator security rights but also the security rights of the Tenants and Organisations as individual entities. In doing this, ATOM allows Meeco components to authorise the actions of all parties within the ecosystem. This creates a robust, secure and accountable exchange of data between the different parties.

## Security Rights
Security rights can be managed at a fine-grained level to maximise the security and management of workflows. By ensuring that only the right Administrators and Organisations have access to the systems and processes they require, the potential for misconduct is greatly reduced. Security right tokens (SRTs) that are generated by ATOM are signed with ATOMâ€™s public key, therefore, any time an SVX component receives a request from a user system, as long as the SRT has been generated by ATOM, the component will recognise the request and act according to the associated security rights.

## Agents  
ATOM has developed entities other than human users and the Tenant(s) or Organisation(s) they belong to. These entities are called Agents and perform actions on behalf of Tenants and Organisations, but the conditions of an Agent are different to human users, for example:
- Agents are private to ATOM.
- An Agent can only be linked to (may only act on behalf of) one Tenant or one Organisation.
- Agents have SRTs just like human users, however, obtaining an Agent SRT is different from obtaining a human SRT. First, a long-lived refresh token is obtained for an Agent. This token can also be used to obtain an Agent SRT with a shorter lifespan. This way, we can guarantee that the SRTs contain the latest security right.

## Event Logs
- ATOM can present a history of security rights changes for any user and for any Tenant or Organisation.
- ATOM can produce reports on assigned security rights within any date range.
- The assignment of security rights can generate email and/or SMS notifications.
