# Tenants, Organisations and End-Users

Within Meeco’s Secure Value Exchange (SVX) platform, different entities have been developed for different purposes. Understanding the difference between these entities, how it maps to users and organisations is important, as it will help you to understand the responsibilities of each.

It is worth noting that regardless of whether you are using Meeco’s APIs, or if you are interacting via our [Portal](/platform/portal.md), the different users and organisations are consistent across both.

## Users and Organisations Explained

Throughout this documentation, the term ‘Users’ broadly refers to individuals interacting with the SVX platform, including our customers' customers and those engaging with various workflows. Within SVX, the term ‘End-users’ specifically denotes Wallet Holders and users associated with a Tenant (refer to the section below for further details).

Please note that the term ‘Organisation’ is occasionally used throughout our documentation as a cover-all term for any enterprise, company, group, or association. When utilising SVX, ‘Organisation’ refers to a specific role played by an enterprise, company, group, or association undertaking actions within a Tenancy.

## Network Participants and their Role

SVX network participants as follows:

| Ecosystem Participant |  Role |
| -- | -- |
| Tenant | A Tenant is operated by an enterprise. Its main responsibility is the governance of its network, participating organisations, and end-users.
| Tenant Administrator | An individual (user) who has administrator access within a Tenant. A Tenant Administrator is responsible for the actions that take place within their Tenant, including the onboarding, management and governance of Organisations.
| Organisation | An Organisation participating in the ecosystem will typically take the role of a credential or data Issuer, Verifier, or both. Organisations connect to End-users to exchange data.
| Organisation Administrator | An individual (user) who has administrator access within an Organisation. An Organisation Administrator can use the Portal to manage the lifecycle of credentials and set up machine-to-machine access.
| End-User | End-users are associated with a Tenant and benefit from services offered by that Tenant including the ability to connect to Issuers, Verifiers, and create a vault.
