#ISSUING A CREDENTIAL

##Introduction

Meeco’s SVX platform allows an organisation to issue Verifiable Credentials (VC) in accordance to the [W3S VC standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/). The following steps allows an organisation to issue a VC and send it to a subject or holder’s wallet. As explained below, VC issuance is achieved by calling our API’s that will perform a series of actions for you.

Note: Issuing a VC is even more convenient via the SVX Portal which offers an easy-to-use GUI flow. 

#Requirements before starting
- 	Set up an Organisation account (includes organisation DID)
- 	Credential Schema is available (JSON)
- 	Subject DID is known
- 	Inputs (example value)
- 	Organisation ID
- 	Issuer DID

##Overview of actions
1.	Create a credential type based on the credential schema
2.	Post claims as required in the credential schema. A series of actions are triggered behind the curtain, such as resolving DID’s, verifying data and rights. This results in a JWT.
3.	Sign credential with DID private DEK
4.	Encrypt credential with DID private DEK
5.	Send the credential tot the wallet of the subject via
