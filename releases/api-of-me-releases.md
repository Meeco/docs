# API-of-Me Releases

## 2021-Q2

### Vault v32.4.3

* Fixed delegate user role for to access user's DEK
* Removed conversations and messages endpoints
* Added client task for re-encrypting the account owners KEK during delegation setup
* Added support multiple JWT issuers for OpenIDConnect Authentication flow.
* Added support seamless identity transition on OpenIDConnect identity provider change.
  * This feature requires OpenIDConnect JWT to enclose a special claim `extension_meecoUserId`
    with value reference to the previous Meeco user identity.
* Added parameters for `GET /connections`:
  * `delegation=granted_to_the_other_user`; the current user has granted delegation to other users
  * `delegation=granted_to_me`; the current user has received delegation from other users
* Changed `GET /session` shows:
  * the type of the session (`oidc` or `token`)
  * if the type of the session is `token`, the access token will be shown
* Added parameters to `GET /items`: it is now possible to fetch only items with a certain name via `?name=foo`
* Added Share intents:
  * `POST /invitations/{invitation_id}/share_intents` to create a share intent
  * `DELETE /share_intents/:id`,
  * `GET /share_intents/:id`
  * `GET /share_intents`
  * Models `Invitation` and `PublicInvitation` have new field `shares_to_be_created`
  * response to `POST /connections` contains a new element: a report on the created connections
* Changed parameters `valid_for` added to `POST /sessions`. `valid_for` defines the number of
  seconds the token is going to be valid
* Changed handling of errors in `POST /items/shares`: field `extra_info` contains
  a subset of incoming parameters with the error.
* Removed image and background color for the Item model (removed fields `image_background_colour`, `background_color` which are realted)
* Removed Item flag `me` from items.
* Changed User field `verified_at` so is hidden.

* Fixed performance on the `POST /items` endpoint
* Changed classification parameters for `POST /items` and `PUT /items` endpoints
* Changed `POST /classification_nodes` to only be used for user managed schemes (tags)
* Changed error messages on `POST /items` endpoint to provide more detailde cause
* Added field `owned_by_user` to classification scheme
* Removed `value` from POST /items, `encrypted_value` field should be used instead
* Removed POST /images endpoint and all image relations on items and users, images (unencrypted) are now only to be used by system
  admins, this helps clear confusion and the risk of user's images being sent up unencrypted.
* Removed associations from users and items
* Added enum definitions to the swagger file (and generated sdk) for the following models:
  * `ClientTask.state`
  * `ClientTask.work_type`

  update it, any slot sent up without an id will be treated as a new slot
* Changed the flow of downloading attachments so fewer API calls are needed (see newly released cli/sdk implementation for example usage)
* Removed fields `is_app_logging_enabled`, `unconfirmed_email`, `share_terms` from model `User`
* Removed UserAccessToken fields `name`, `device_push_token`, `push_token_platform`
* Added `item_ids` parameter to retrieve multiple specific items at once. e.g.  `GET /items?item_ids=abc,xyz,foo,bar`

* `attachment_id` in slots no longer changes when sharing a slot with an attachment
* Changed the shape of the nested attachment json (on POST /items etc)
* Removed `slots.attachment_uid` as `attachment_id` does not change upon share now.
* Changed behaviour of attachements to enforce data integrity
  * once a slot has an attachment, it is not permitted to remove or replace the attachment
  * once a slot has an attachments folder, it is not permitted to remove or replace the attachments folder
* Changed the urls generated by the server for images and thumbnails. Redirects are now handled by 2 endpoints:
  * `GET /blobs/public/{id}/{digest}` - for images and thumbnails
  * `GET /blobs/attachment/{id}/{digest}` - for attachments and direct attachments
* Removed `PUT /slots/:id`. Instead, `PUT /items/:id` should be used.

  * `POST /attachments_folders`
  * `GET /attachments_folders`
  * `GET /attachments_folders/:id`
  * `DELETE /attachments_folders/:id`

  * To attach an existing attachments folder use property `attachments_folder_id`, see model `NestedSlotAttributes`
  * To access a attachments folders data use `GET /slots/:slot_id/attachments_folder`
* Added new parameters for `GET /items`:
  * `own` boolean, if true adds constraint `items.user_id = items.owner_id`, if false adds
    constraint `items.user_id != items.owner_id`
  * `owner_id`, if present, adds constraint `items.owner_id = 'parameter goes here'`
* Removed Field `encrypted` in `Slot`
* Removed fields `cloudname`, `key_store_admission_token`, `key_store_id`,
  `key_store_url`, `key_store_username` in `User`

### CLI v2.0.0

* `users:get` renamed to `users:login`, has the effect of recreating tokens if expired.
* `users:get` now returns user's id and other user info.
* `shares:create-config` takes connection and item config files (output of `connections:create` and `items:create`) instead of the respective ids.

* `client-task-queue` commands now have `--limit` parameter
* added `items:create-thumbnail`
* `meeco items:list` allow filtering list by `templateId`, `scheme`, `classification` and `sharedWith`.
* added `oidc_token` OIDC token header support for authenticating user.

### SDK v2.0.0

* Major revamp of Services API:
  * All custom service methods specify the required credentials by interfaces
  * Services provide their base APIs via the `getAPI` method
  * Services with paginated responses offer a `listAll` method
* Added Service for delegating child users
* Added cryppo wrapper classes `SymmetricKey` and `PublicKey` to simplify key usage within SDK
* Added classes for manipulating Items and Slots: `DecryptedItem` for client-side copies, `NewItem` and `ItemUpdate` for pending changes.
* Added demo app for sharing and delegation
* added `oidc_token` OIDC token header support for authenticating user.

### Vault API v19.3.0

* Add user_public_key to response of `GET /invitations/{:token}`
* Remove `child_public_key_for_login` parameter from `POST /child_users`
* Update description of `sharing_mode` in `POST /items/{id}/shares`
* New field `item_shared_via_another_share_id` in ShareWithItemData If this field is NULL it means that the rendered item has been created via the currently displayed share. If `item_shared_via_another_share_id` is not NULL, it means that the rendered item has been created via a different share, and the ID if the share is in `item_shared_via_another_share_id`. The client is advised to re-run the call with this ID.
* Change default behaviour of `GET /client-task-queue` to not change task states `supress_changing_state` parameter has been changed to change_state to reflect the change.
* Add delegation_token parameter description in `POST /invitations`
* Change behavour of GET /client_task_queue
  * Will now return items of all states by default
  * Accepts a list of states instead of a single state as before

* Support for OIDC2
* Added filter target_id to `GET /client_task_queue`: `GET /client_task_queue?target_id=id`
* Add `GET /event_feed endpoint`
* Swagger models `Slot`, `Attachment`, and `DirectAttachment` all have a new field: `attachment_uid`. The function of `attachment_uid` is to signal whether the actual file referenced from two different attachments is the same or not. In other words, when an attachment is shared to a different user, a new attachment record is created with a new id, but `attachment_uid` stays the same. This ID cannot be used to retrieve the attachment.
* added filter `classification_node_names` to `GET /items: GET /items?classification_node_names=value_1,value_2,value_3`
* added filter `shared_with` to `GET /items: GET /items?shared_with=user_id`. If present, only items will be fetched which have been shared with the given user. Works for items owned by the current user as well as for items owned by someone else and on-shared by the current user.

* Add `POST /delegations/:delegation_token/claim` endpoint
* Added user delegation header `Meeco-Delegation-Id`. `Meeco-Delegation-Id` contains the ID of a user that the current user has delegation permissions for. If delegation has been set up correctly, the current user of the action will be the user in `Meeco-Delegation-Id`
* Remove encryption spaces endpoints
* Dropped support for `POST /keypairs/external_id/:external_id/` decrypt_session_token
